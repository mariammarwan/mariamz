First i don't know how to use github so excuse my randomness
Second about explaining how the web works : i knew before that the web development consists of back end and front end, and the main concept is that an engineer works on a server to display some information to user
for the front end section: that's where the user see the information and interact with the server
for the backend sec: that's where the engineer works on the server to be able to display the information
and there are some protocols or smth for these actions to be done
that's what i know for now
